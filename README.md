The Datapack currently adds 38 Adventure Advancements, 10 Story Advancements, 11 Husbandry Advancements, 5 End Advancements and 4 Nether Advancements! Most of these Advancements can be completed by simply playing the game and exploring the world, but some will require more effort and dedication to achieeve. Will you rise to the challenge? The Datapack also includes a built-in counter, so you can compete with friends to see who can finish all 185 Advancements first!

## Hardcode Mode
There are a few Advancements in this pack that require death in some way. If you want to use this pack in Hardcore, you can download it [HERE.](https://modrinth.com/project/better_advancements_hardcore) This is intended for Hardcore players so you can still complete all of the Advancements without having to die.

## Colored Advancements
